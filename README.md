# Homework 0: Course Setup

**Due:** Tuesday, January 21, 2020 *before* class 

This is an *ungraded, but required* assignment. It will cover the necessary steps to get set up for the semester.

*For this assignment only -- you may ask others in the class for help with these setup tasks.*

To demonstrate that you have completed the setup tasks, you will be asked questions to answer in a report that you will submit.  
* Undergraduates *may* complete this report in Markdown (see [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)). Or, you may choose to use LaTeX instead (see below).
* Graduate students *must* complete this report using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) generated to a PDF file (submit both the LaTeX source and PDF). Note that for the sections related to Markdown, you will also be creating a Markdown file, `HW0-markdown.md`.

Your report should be named `HW0-report.{md, tex, pdf}`, with the proper extension.  ***Do not edit this file, `README.md`***

All reports must include your name, class, assignment number/title, and date.  You do not need a title page.  Note that there are sections below on setup for both Markdown and LaTeX.

## Class Website

We will be using several websites for class this semester. The main class website (https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mweigle/CS432-S20/) should be your first stop -- it contains links to all of the other sites that are needed.

**Q1.** Explore the [class website](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mweigle/CS432-S20/). Where can you find lecture topics and assignments?

## Piazza

We will be using Piazza for class communication. I will post important announcements through Piazza rather than email. You can adjust your settings so that you receive an email each time a new post is made. You should have already received an email invitation to join the class Piazza group (if you have not received this invitation, email me directly - mweigle@cs.odu.edu). 

**Q2.** Make a posting using the `hw0` tag in our class Piazza group. The posting should just be a brief introduction of yourself to the rest of the class. Copy the text of your posting into your report.

## Git, GitHub

Git is a version control system for tracking changes in source code, used in the popular [GitHub](https://github.com) code hosting platform.  To become familiar with the basics of Git, read [git - the simple guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).

If you do not have one already, you must create a GitHub account.  I recommend a username that incorporates at least part of your actual name (e.g., mine is [weiglemc](https://github.com/weiglemc)).

We will also be the statistical language [R](https://www.r-project.org) and a popular IDE, [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com).  You can manage your GitHub repositories through RStudio.  

Follow the instructions at [github-classroom-for-students](https://github.com/cs432-websci-master/github-classroom-for-students/blob/master/README.md) to get set up with GitHub and RStudio.  There will be more about R and RStudio later.

**Q3.** Answer the following questions:
* a) What is your GitHub username?
* b) Accept the GitHub Classroom invitation for HW0.  What is the URL of the generated repo?

## Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is widely used in GitHub, especially for README pages.  Review the following guides:
* [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
* [GitHub's Basic Writing and Formatting Syntax guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

If you are using LaTeX for your report, you must also create a `HW0-markdown.md` file for this section. 

**Q4.** Work the following exercises in your Markdown report:
* a) Create an ordered list with at least 3 items
* b) Write a paragraph that demonstrates the use of *italics*, **bold**, ***bold italics***, and `inline code`.
* c) Create an example of a fenced code block.
* d) Create a level 4 heading

## LaTeX and Overleaf

LaTeX is *the* markup language for academic publication. [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com) provides an online setup for writing and compiling LaTeX into PDF.  

Sign up for a free [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com) account.

Walk through [part 1](https://learn.sharelatex.com/learn/Free_online_introduction_to_LaTeX_(part_1)) and [part 2](https://learn.sharelatex.com/learn/Free_online_introduction_to_LaTeX_(part_2)) of this [LaTeX introduction](https://learn.sharelatex.com/learn/Free_online_introduction_to_LaTeX_(part_1)). 

**Q5.** Copy the LaTeX source for your solution to Typesetting Exercise 1 (slide 11) from part 1 of the intro into your report.  Download the generated PDF from Overleaf.  If you are using Markdown, push the generated PDF to your repo and include a link to it in your report. If you are using LaTeX for your report, include the PDF as an image in your report.

## ODU-CS Linux

We will be using the [ODU-CS Linux systems](https://systems.cs.odu.edu/Unix_and_Linux_Services) for part of the course (read the information in the linked webpage). If you do not already have an account, request one at https://accounts.cs.odu.edu/validate/

If you are not familiar with Unix/Linux systems, I strongly encourage you to read the materials from [CS 252 - Unix for Programmers](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs252/latest/Directory/outline/index.html). 

**Q6.** Read the [Web Services page](https://systems.cs.odu.edu/Web_Services) and create a basic HTML page. (You can copy the code from this [simple HTML page](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_basic_document) or do something more elaborate.)  Put the URL to your webpage in your report. (Make sure that the link works.)

## Python

You can use Python 3 on the ODU-CS Linux machines *(make sure to use /usr/bin/python3 and **not** /usr/bin/python)* or you can [download it ](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and run on your local machine.  Review some of the [important differences between Python 2.7 and Python 3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/important-differences-between-python-2-x-and-python-3-x-with-examples/).

**Q7.** Pick one of the simple examples from [Python examples](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_examples.asp) and execute it. Take a screenshot of the terminal and include as a figure in your report.

## R, RStudio

We will be using some of the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) tutorials to setup and get a quick introduction to R. 

To finish the your R setup, read and follow the instructions from [Section 1.4.3 (The tidyverse)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#the-tidyverse) through [Section 1.6 (Getting help and learning more)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#getting-help-and-learning-more). 

For a quick introduction to R, start with [Section 3 (Data Visualization)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) and read through [Section 3.2 (First steps)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#first-steps) and then skip to [Section 3.4 (Common Problems)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#common-problems). 

**Q8.** Section 3.2 shows a scatterplot of hwy vs. displ using the mpg data.  Create a scatterplot of hwy vs. cyl.  Include the R code used to generate the chart and a PNG version of the chart in your report.

## Submission

Make sure that you have committed and pushed your local repo to the shared repository on GitHub.  Your repo should include at least `README.md` (this file), `HW0-report.{md, tex, pdf}`, and any image files you've included in your report. In addition, if you are using LaTeX, you must also include `HW0-markdown.md`.

Submit the URL of your GitHub project in Blackboard:

* Click on HW0 under Homeworks
* Under "Assignment Submission", click the "Write Submission" button.
* Copy/paste the URL of your repo into the edit box
  * should be something like https<nolink>://github.com/cs432-websci-spr20/hw0-setup-*username*
* Make sure to "Submit" your assignment.
